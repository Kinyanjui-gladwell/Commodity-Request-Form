## âœ… Data Validation Rules

The system enforces the following rules when submitting a commodity request:

1. **Whole Numbers Only**: Quantity must be a whole number (integers only).
2. **Maximum Quantity per Request**: Quantity must be **less than 100** per individual request.
3. **Monthly Cap**: A CHW can request **no more than 200 units per commodity per month**.
4. **One Request per Day Rule**: Only **one request per CHW per commodity per day** is allowed.
5. **Dynamic Commodity List**: Commodities are dynamically listed and can be added without modifying the form.

Validation is enforced both at the server side and through user feedback in the form.
